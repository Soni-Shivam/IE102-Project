# IE102 – Probability and Statistics Projects (Freshman Year)

This repository contains two open-ended projects completed as part of **IE102: Introduction to Probability and Statistics**, a freshman year course at **IIT Bombay**

In this course, the final project topics were open-ended — students were encouraged to explore **anything related to probability and statistics**. These projects were intended to be short and exploratory, helping us apply what we learned in class while getting hands-on experience to the simulating.

These are my takes on the assignment:

## 📁 Projects

### 🔹 [Erdős–Rényi Randomized Graphs](./Erdos-Renyi-Randomized-Graphs)
A project exploring the **Erdős–Rényi model**, a simple but powerful framework in random graph theory. The code demonstrates:

- Threshold-based graph connectivity  
- Emergence of a giant component  
- Epidemic spreading over networks  
- Clustering comparison with structured graphs

### 🔹 [F1 Race Outcome Prediction Using Multivariable Linear Regression](./F1-Race-Prediction)
This project uses **multivariable linear regression** to explore how different quantifiable factors — such as qualifying positions, team performance, and past results — affect the final positions of drivers in **Formula 1** races.

> These projects were not intended to be deeply technical but rather served as a way to encourage freshmen to **explore**, **learn**, and **apply** new concepts through small self-driven experiments.

Feel free to explore the individual folders to see the implementations and project reports!
